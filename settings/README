Copy or rename the default files to their respective names (without .default),
and make the following changes:

app.php:

	ROOT_URL should be the relative path of the site from the hostname.
	ex. If the site is running at http://localhost/bw, ROOT_URL should be
	"bw"

	or if the site is running at http://localhost/, ROOT_URL should be an empty
	string.

	APP_ROOT should be the absolute path to the top level directory, where
	index.php, routes.php, and url_router.php are all found.



database.php:

	(Can be left as-is, for now.)
