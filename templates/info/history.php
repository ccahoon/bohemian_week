<p>
can be traced back to the winter of
&#39;10, when <a href="/info/founders">four room mates</a>, all students at the University of Maryland,
Baltimore County, decided that finals week was not a time of despair, but a
time to celebrate the togetherness of the past semester, as it came to a
close. They set their computers up in the common area of their on-campus
apartment, so that they could enjoy each other&#39;s company and support when
they were working hard. They worked hard so that they could finish their work
with time to spare for joyful celebrations of togetherness. They participated
in active celebrations of togetherness to remind themselves that life is good,
and of the immeasurable value of friendship.

<h3>The Spread of Bohemian Week</h3>

<p>
came the following spring, when those
Bohemian pioneers realized that they had been unforgivably selfish, and in
fact had violated the Bohemian Spirit, by not sharing their discovery.
To facilitate sharing of their new way of experiencing finals week, they
began calling it Bohemian Week, and they began calling their celebrations of
togetherness Activities. The first Bohemian Week flourished.

<h3>Activities</h3>

<p>
were so called for their active (as opposed to passive)
nature; those participants of the first Bohemian Week were encouraged, when
not working hard, to seek out their fellow Bohemians, simply to be together. The
founders realized that it was very easy to fall into the habit of being alone,
and sad, when faced with the pressure of finals, and the often lonely task of
preparing for them. It was therefore important to be active about enjoying
the company of friends at school during those final days of the semester.
